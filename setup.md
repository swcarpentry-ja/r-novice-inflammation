This lesson assumes you have the R software and the development environment RStudio installed on your computer.

[R can be downloaded here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).

[RStudio can be downloaded here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
You will need the Desktop version for your computer.

You also need to download some files to follow this lesson:

1. Make a new folder in your Desktop called `r-novice-inflammation`.
2. Download [r-novice-inflammation-data.zip]({{ page.root }}/files/r-novice-inflammation-data.zip) and move the file to this folder.
3. If it's not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it. You should end up with a new folder called `data`.
4. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop/r-novice-inflammation/data
~~~
{: .language-bash}
